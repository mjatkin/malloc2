--------------------------------------------------
Before running any make commands, we first need init the file structure
    1. run 'make init'

We can then compile for either release or debug (release will work just fine for
the marking, debug just prints out a bunch of stuff that will slow the execution
down tremendiously)
    2. run 'make release' or 'make debug'

We then run the program as release or debug depending on what we compiled
    3. run './bin/release/malloc2.out [STRATERGY]' or './bin/debug/malloc2.out [STRATERGY]'

The stratergies we can use are 'first', 'best' and 'worst'

eg. make init
    make release
    ./bin/release/malloc2.out best
